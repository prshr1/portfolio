This project involved designing and maintaining a segmented home and lab network to support experimental hardware, student devices, cameras, and remote access without compromising reliability or security. The network is structured around multiple VLANs isolating IoT devices, guest traffic, cameras, and experimental systems, with zone-based firewall rules enforcing strict access boundaries.

A dedicated 2.4 GHz student VLAN with static IP allocation supports embedded devices and microcontrollers, while a site-to-site VPN enables secure remote access for monitoring and maintenance. UniFi Protect is used for video security, and ongoing firmware management ensures long-term stability.

The project reflects a systems-engineering mindset applied to infrastructure: anticipating failure modes, isolating risk, and designing for observability rather than convenience.
