I serve as a hybrid and liquid propulsion safety and technical mentor for FAROUT (Friends of Amateur Rocketry: Oxidizers Uninhibited Tournament), a collegiate rocketry competition focused on advanced propulsion systems. My role involves reviewing propulsion hardware, feed systems, test procedures, and flight-readiness documentation for multiple teams across different institutions.

Beyond formal reviews, I support teams through design iteration, failure analysis, and go/no-go decision-making during static fires and launch operations. This includes assessing single-fault risks, thermal and pressure margins, and operational readiness under real-time constraints.

For FAROUT 2025, I successfully oversaw multiple teams through safe static-fire and launch operations. For FAROUT 2026, I was appointed as an official team mentor for Columbia Rocketry and several international teams, providing ongoing guidance throughout their development cycles.
