This teaching project was developed to address a recurring gap in machining education: students could follow feeds-and-speeds tables but lacked a generalized understanding of why machines behave the way they do. I designed and delivered a multi-part lecture series that reframes machining from first principles, starting with material hardness (BHN), unit power, spindle torque, and duty cycles.

Rather than optimizing for specific tools or machines, the framework emphasizes transferable reasoning applicable across different CNC platforms and materials. Topics include spindle power curves, thermal limits, tool engagement dynamics, chip thinning, and the tradeoffs between high-speed and high-efficiency machining.

The series enabled students to push machines confidently and safely, replacing fear-driven conservatism with informed judgment. The curriculum has since influenced shop SOPs and advanced workshop offerings.

## Series Design Goal
**Insight:** Replace memorized feeds-and-speeds with portable first-principles reasoning

The lecture sequence was built to help students estimate safe and efficient cuts from machine limits, material properties, and engagement geometry. Instead of treating CAM presets as fixed truths, each module teaches how to derive a defensible starting point and adjust from measured behavior at the machine.

## Core Technical Modules
**Insight:** Power, torque, chip-load physics, and thermal limits tied into one decision flow

The middle lectures connect spindle power curves, torque at low RPM, radial chip thinning, and heat generation so students can predict when a strategy will chatter, rub, or overload. This made it easier to choose between high-efficiency and high-speed paths based on machine capability rather than preference.

## Operational Impact in the Shop
**Insight:** Students moved from conservative trial-and-error to bounded, explainable process tuning

After deployment, students were able to justify parameter changes with simple calculations and machine constraints. The material was reused in SOP discussions and advanced workshop sessions, improving consistency across different machines and operators.
