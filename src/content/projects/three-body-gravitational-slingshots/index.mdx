This project explores gravitational slingshot dynamics beyond the classical two-body approximation by modeling hyperbolic flybys in full three-body systems. I developed a unified analytical and numerical framework to quantify energy ceilings in close-in gravitational slingshots, combining closed-form hyperbolic scattering theory with large-scale three-body Monte Carlo simulation in a hot Jupiter system. Starting from first principles, together with my PI, Dr. David Kipping, we derived strict two-body kinematic limits and geometric vector plateaus, then I built a high-fidelity integrator to test how real trajectories behave in a deep stellar potential. 

The results show that while no trajectory exceeds the stellar two-body energy ceiling, three-body dynamics can amplify energy gains far beyond classical planet-only bounds through structured angular momentum exchange consistent with conservation of the Jacobi constant. This project demonstrates rigorous theoretical derivation, invariant-based diagnostics, and large-scale numerical validation to uncover efficiency frontiers in multi-body orbital systems.

## Analytical Foundations
**Insight:** Hyperbolic Scattering and Energy Ceilings

At the core of the project is a closed-form solution to two-body hyperbolic scattering. In the rest frame of a gravitating body, the asymptotic velocity magnitude is conserved:

$$
|\mathbf{v}_{\infty}^{(+)}|
=
|\mathbf{v}_{\infty}^{(-)}|
=
v_{\infty}
$$

The encounter only rotates the velocity vector by a deflection angle

$$
\theta
=
2 \arctan\!\left(
\frac{\mu}{b v_{\infty}^2}
\right)
$$

where $\mu$ is the standard gravitational parameter and $b$ is the impact parameter.

Transforming back to the inertial frame yields a strict kinematic ceiling for an unpowered gravity assist:

$$
\Delta V_{\max}
=
2 v_{\infty}
$$

This is the true kinematic ceiling and establishes the fundamental single-encounter speed gain limit, independent of numerical simulation.

## Numerical Engine
**Insight:** Large-Scale Three-Body Monte Carlo Simulation

To explore behavior beyond idealized two-body theory, I built a high-fidelity three-body integrator modeling a starâ€“planetâ€“particle system. Over 24,000 trajectories were simulated using adaptive integration, randomized initial conditions, and strict physical filtering (unbound states, stellar clearance constraints, planetary encounter thresholds).

For each trajectory, I tracked:

- Star-centric specific orbital energy
- Planet-relative hyperbolic excess velocity
- Angular momentum evolution
- Velocity vector change magnitude

## Energy Efficiency Frontiers
**Insight:** Scalar Speed vs. Vector Rotation Limits

Two distinct ceilings emerge:

**Scalar speed gain ceiling**

$$
\eta_{\text{speed}} = \frac{\Delta{V}}{{v}_{\infty,\text{p}}} \leq 1
$$

**Vector change plateau**

$$
\eta_{\text{vector}} = \frac{|\Delta{V}|}{2\sqrt2{v}_{\infty,\text{p}}}
$$

The first represents a physically meaningful energy frontier.
The second reflects a purely geometric upper bound in Euclidean velocity space.

In close-in hot Jupiter systems, trajectories frequently approach the scalar ceiling and cluster near vector-efficiency plateaus, revealing near-optimal angular deflection geometries.

## Breaking the Planet-Only Ceiling
**Insight:** Three-Body Amplification in a Deep Stellar Potential

Classical gravity assist analysis assumes the planet dominates locally. In a close-in system, this assumption fails: the stellar potential remains strong throughout the encounter.

Simulations demonstrate that three-body trajectories exceed the planet-only two-body energy ceiling by over two orders of magnitude, yet remain strictly below the stellar two-body bound.

The planet does not supply energy directly; rather, it acts as a geometric lever that redirects trajectories inside a deep stellar potential well, unlocking kinetic energy otherwise inaccessible in a purely two-body framework.

## Invariant Diagnostics
**Insight:** Energyâ€“Angular Momentum Coupling via Jacobi Constant

To confirm physical consistency, results were analyzed in the framework of the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP), where the conserved quantity is the Jacobi constant:

$$
C = -2\Omega - |\dot{{r}}|^2
$$

In dimensional form, inertial energy changes are coupled to angular momentum exchange:

$$
\Delta\mathcal{E} \propto {\Omega} \cdot \Delta{L}
$$

Monte Carlo results exhibit this correlation explicitly: large energy boosts correspond to large changes in angular momentum delivered by planetary torque.

This confirms that observed amplification arises from structured three-body dynamics rather than numerical artifacts.
