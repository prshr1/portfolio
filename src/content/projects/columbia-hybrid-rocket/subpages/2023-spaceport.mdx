Role: Rocket Project Lead

Senior year expanded scope from propulsion authority to program-level systems leadership. The work centered on integrating people, architecture, operations, and test cadence into a launch-ready vehicle.

## Program Leadership and Vehicle Redesign
**Insight:** Directed a 50+ member team through a full architecture transition.

I led cross-subteam execution across propulsion, structures, avionics, and recovery, while driving the transition from a legacy 4.5-inch configuration to a modular 6-inch architecture. This redesign improved subsystem packaging, load paths, and operational maintainability.

## Propulsion Stack and Valve-System Evolution
**Insight:** Advanced integration decisions from component-level to mission-level reliability.

The propulsion stack was standardized for field operations, including integration strategy updates such as moving from pyrovalve-triggered behavior toward servo-actuated ball-valve control concepts. The objective was higher repeatability, simpler troubleshooting, and safer operations.

## Static Fire and Launch Readiness Campaign
**Insight:** Converted bench validation into flight readiness through coordinated ops discipline.

I oversaw static-fire planning, test-readiness reviews, and field deployment sequencing so subsystem maturity translated into launch confidence. This included aligning hardware readiness, procedural readiness, and team-role clarity under schedule pressure.

## Spaceport Execution and First Flight
**Insight:** Achieved the team's first 6-inch hybrid rocket flight through full-system integration.

The program culminated at Spaceport America Cup with successful launch operations and flight execution of the first 6-inch hybrid in team history. This milestone represented not just propulsion success, but end-to-end systems engineering and operational leadership.
