Role: Combustion Chamber Lead

This year marked the transition from nozzle-centric work to full propulsion subsystem ownership. The focus shifted to integrating injector, chamber, liner, feed instrumentation, and hot-fire validation into a single engineering loop.

## Propulsion Subsystem Integration
**Insight:** Integrated nozzle, liner, injector, and chamber architecture as one validated system.

I led integration of the graphite nozzle stack with chamber interfaces and insulation strategy, while driving injector iteration against oxidizer mass-flow targets. Work emphasized interface robustness, manufacturability, and thermal survivability under expected burn conditions.

## Instrumentation and Test Infrastructure
**Insight:** Built high-pressure data pathways to make hot-fire results decision-grade.

I helped define and validate high-pressure feed and instrumentation architecture, including thrust-stand signal quality, load cell calibration workflow, and repeatable DAQ handling. The objective was to convert static fires into quantifiable design feedback instead of one-off demos.

## Static Fire Correlation
**Insight:** Closed the loop between simulation predictions and measured thrust behavior.

Static-fire campaigns were used to compare predicted performance against recorded thrust and pressure behavior. This validation step surfaced model biases, improved confidence bounds, and guided follow-on design decisions for flight-intent hardware.

## Thermal and Structural Validation
**Insight:** Treated thermal and structural margins as mission constraints, not afterthoughts.

Transient thermal and structural checks were incorporated into design iteration so combustion and load environments were evaluated before hardware lock-in. That discipline enabled propulsion decisions to be made within system-level safety and reliability boundaries.
