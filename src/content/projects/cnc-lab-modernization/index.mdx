As Lead Machinist and CNC Programmer in the Columbia Mechanical Engineering Teaching Lab, I was responsible for maintaining, restoring, and upgrading over ten CNC and manual machines used daily by hundreds of students. This included recommissioning a legacy Fadal VMC15, retrofitting Tormach mills with probing, tool-offset systems, and coolant upgrades, and restoring machines that had been out of service due to wear or control limitations.

One of the most impactful contributions was the development of a custom Anilam post-processor, enabling modern CAM toolpaths on older Fryer CNC mills that previously lacked full G-code compatibility. This effectively expanded the lab's CAM-capable machining capacity without purchasing new equipment.

I also designed custom fixtures, machined tight-tolerance components, digitized tool inventories, and authored SOPs that significantly reduced downtime while improving safety and throughput during peak academic periods.
