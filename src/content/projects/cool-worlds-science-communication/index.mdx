As a video editor and content producer for the Cool Worlds YouTube channel, I collaborate with professional astrophysicists to translate active research topics into accessible, visually compelling narratives. Over the past several years, I have edited and produced 30+ long-form videos and projects reaching over 10 million cumulative views worldwide.

My role goes beyond post-production. I actively participate in storyboarding, visual sequencing, and narrative pacing to ensure complex concepts such as gravitational lensing, exoplanet detection methods, and cosmological modeling are communicated accurately without overwhelming non-technical audiences. This requires deliberate choices about what technical detail to omit, what metaphors to introduce, and where precision must be preserved.

This work has fundamentally shaped how I design technical systems and research pipelines: documentation, clarity of intent, and the ability to explain why something works are treated as core engineering requirements rather than afterthoughts.
