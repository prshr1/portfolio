As a video editor and content producer for the Cool Worlds YouTube channel, I collaborate with professional astrophysicists to translate active research topics into accessible, visually compelling narratives. Over the past several years, I have edited and produced 30+ long-form videos and projects reaching over 10 million cumulative views worldwide.

My role goes beyond post-production. I actively participate in storyboarding, visual sequencing, and narrative pacing to ensure complex concepts such as gravitational lensing, exoplanet detection methods, and cosmological modeling are communicated accurately without overwhelming non-technical audiences. This requires deliberate choices about what technical detail to omit, what metaphors to introduce, and where precision must be preserved.

This work has fundamentally shaped how I design technical systems and research pipelines: documentation, clarity of intent, and the ability to explain why something works are treated as core engineering requirements rather than afterthoughts.

## Worldwide Reach With Technical Rigor
**Insight:** Each episode is structured to keep astrophysical rigor while reducing cognitive load for non-specialists.

My editing workflow starts with technical decomposition: identifying which equations, assumptions, and caveats must survive the cut. This video is my highest performing edit at 2.7M view worldwide. It explores the concept of quantum immortality, a speculative idea derived from the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which suggests that every possible outcome of a quantum event occurs in some branch of a constantly splitting multiverse. According to this idea, a version of you could always survive even extremely unlikely or lethal events, because in some branch of reality you continue to live — leading to the claim that you would never subjectively experience death. The concept is highly theoretical and controversial, with most physicists treating it as philosophical speculation rather than testable science.

## Science Communication
**Insight:** Timing edits, visual emphasis, and transition density are tuned to match topic complexity in real time.

This was my first editing project for the channel, and it set the tone for how I approach communicating complex ideas and visual mediums. The video explores the Fermi Paradox, which questions why we have not yet observed evidence of extraterrestrial civilizations despite the vastness of the universe and the high probability of habitable planets. The video delves into various hypotheses that attempt to explain this paradox, such as the Great Filter, the Rare Earth hypothesis, and the possibility that advanced civilizations are deliberately avoiding contact. The topic is complex and speculative, requiring careful pacing to keep viewers engaged while navigating through abstract concepts and scientific theories.

## Production System For Repeatable Quality
**Insight:** A repeatable editorial pipeline enables consistent quality across long-form episodes with different scientific domains.

This was the first time one of my edits reached over 1M views, and it was a major milestone for myself. The video explores the future of Earth over the next billion years, examining how various factors such as solar evolution, geological processes, and potential human interventions could shape the planet's environment and habitability. The video discusses scenarios like the gradual increase in solar luminosity leading to a runaway greenhouse effect, the eventual loss of Earth's oceans, and the long-term prospects for life on our planet. The topic is both scientifically rich and speculative, requiring a careful balance between engaging storytelling and accurate representation of current scientific understanding.
