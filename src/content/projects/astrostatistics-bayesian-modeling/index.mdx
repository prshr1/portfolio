Integrated Statistical Inference in Observational Astrophysics
From Cosmological Expansion to Dark Matter Model Discrimination

Across five computationally intensive astrophysics investigations, I developed and validated a unified statistical inference framework spanning cosmology, stellar atmospheres, exoplanet detection, and galactic dynamics. The work integrates weighted regression, full Bayesian inference via custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, cross-validation protocols, and information-theoretic model comparison (AIC/BIC) to rigorously test competing physical hypotheses against noisy observational data.

Rather than applying statistical tools as black-box routines, I derived likelihood functions directly from physical models including Planck radiation laws, transit geometries, Keplerian radial velocity equations, and modified gravitational dynamics. I explicitly validated convergence, posterior structure, and residual behavior, with emphasis on diagnosing model degeneracies, parameter non-convergence, and regimes where data precision is insufficient for robust model discrimination. Synthetic data generation and controlled error scaling were used to estimate the minimum information threshold required for 5-sigma separation in dark matter versus MOND analyses.

## Cosmological Parameter Estimation
**Insight:** Weighted regression plus bootstrap validation provides a reproducible estimate of $H_0$ and propagated cosmological timescales.

Using Type Ia supernova distance modulus measurements, I re-estimated the Hubble constant via weighted least squares and independently verified the solution through bootstrap resampling. The governing model assumes linear expansion:

$$
v = H_0 d
$$

The weighted normal-equation solution was implemented to verify `np.polyfit` outputs analytically. Measurement uncertainties were incorporated explicitly through inverse-variance weighting, and 1000 bootstrap realizations were generated by sampling perturbations from Gaussian error distributions.

The resulting posterior distribution of $H_0^{-1}$ enabled propagation to the Hubble time:

$$
t_H = \frac{1}{H_0}
$$

This yielded an age estimate with statistically consistent uncertainty bounds. Correlation structure between slope and intercept was analyzed via corner plots, ensuring parameter covariance was quantified rather than assumed negligible.

## Bayesian Thermal Modeling of Brown Dwarfs
**Insight:** A custom MCMC implementation of Planck-law fitting exposed posterior sensitivity and validated robust convergence across priors.

To estimate the effective temperature of cool brown dwarfs, I implemented a custom MCMC sampler to fit the Planck distribution to log-linear spectral flux data. The forward model was derived directly from radiative transfer:

$$
B_\lambda(T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5}
\left( e^{\frac{hc}{\lambda k T}} - 1 \right)^{-1}
$$

A Gaussian-error log-likelihood was used:

$$
\ln \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_i
\frac{(F_i - F_{\text{model},i})^2}{\sigma_i^2}
$$

I evaluated uniform, log-uniform, and $T^4$-scaled priors to assess posterior sensitivity. Convergence was demonstrated with burn-in diagnostics, walker trace plots, and repeated-initialization robustness checks. Posterior correlation between temperature and scaling parameters was explicitly quantified. Five independent chains converging to statistically consistent medians validated both algorithmic correctness and posterior stability.

*The raw data points come in log-linear space, with the flux in logarithmic scale and the wavelength in a linear scale. Plotting a black-body distribution on this interval and fitting it manually gives us this.*

## Transit Signal Extraction and Noise Modeling
**Insight:** Frequency-guided initialization combined with global Bayesian detrending improves transit depth reliability under correlated systematics.

For exoplanet transit analysis, I built a preprocessing pipeline combining robust outlier rejection (5-point moving median with 3-sigma clipping), periodogram-based frequency initialization, and MCMC detrending. The global flux model included linear drift and thermal oscillations:

$$
F(t) = a t + b + A_1 \sin(\omega_1 t) + A_2 \sin(\omega_2 t)
$$

before fitting trapezoidal transit depth. Detrending was performed globally rather than transit-isolated to avoid biasing likelihood structure.

Model adequacy was evaluated using reduced chi-square and RMS-versus-binsize scaling, verifying white-noise behavior through:

$$
\text{RMS} \propto N^{-1/2}
$$

Bootstrapped uncertainties were propagated through transit depth estimates, and residual histograms confirmed near-Gaussian error behavior.

*The following model was used in the MCMC algorithm to detrend the data, using a linear term and an offset to detrend the drift in flux and two sinusoidal terms to detrend the oscillation in flux from heating and cooling of sensors.*

## Exoplanet Detection Significance Reassessment
**Insight:** Information criteria and cross-validation showed that added model complexity did not consistently generalize for Gliese 581 g.

I re-evaluated the claimed 4.7-sigma detection of Gliese 581 g using multi-planet radial velocity models and independent validation techniques. Competing models of varying planetary complexity were fit via chi-square minimization and evaluated with AIC, BIC, and 24-fold cross-validation:

$$
\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\ln \mathcal{L},
\quad
\text{BIC} = k \ln n - 2\ln \mathcal{L}
$$

MCMC validation of best-fit parameters revealed non-convergent phase behavior, signaling parameter degeneracy. Cross-validation indicated that higher-complexity models did not consistently outperform simpler alternatives across folds, reducing support for the originally claimed detection significance.

*Once the four models have been computed, we calculate several model comparison metrics $\Chi^2$ minimization, AIC, and BIC to obtain a first estimation of the best-fitting model.*

*K-folding training allows for the partitioning of data into k equally sized parts and using each fold as a validation set, while the remaining k-1 folds are used to train the model. The 24-fold technique is the most exhaustive and homogeneous.*

## Dark Matter vs. MOND Model Discrimination
**Insight:** Synthetic error-scaling experiments identified explicit data-quality thresholds required for statistically decisive dark-matter versus MOND separation.

In a comparative study of cold dark matter halo models versus MOND disk dynamics, I fit galaxy rotation curves using chi-square minimization and MCMC validation of parameters including critical acceleration $a_{\text{crit}}$. Model selection used AIC/BIC divergence analysis across galaxies.

To probe discriminative limits, I generated synthetic datasets with progressively reduced uncertainties and evaluated the minimum sample size required for 5-sigma separation between theories. The MOND acceleration law tested was:

$$
\mu\!\left(\frac{a}{a_{\text{crit}}}\right) a = a_N
$$

Non-convergence of $a_{\text{crit}}$ in several systems exposed parameter insensitivity under realistic error regimes. By quantifying precision requirements (approximately 12 high-quality points for decisive separation in NGC 3198), this work moved beyond model fitting toward information-limit analysis.
