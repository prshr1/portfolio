HERO BACKGROUND VIDEO PLACEHOLDER
==================================

This is a placeholder. Replace this with your actual video file:

1. Prepare your video file (MP4 format recommended for best browser support)
2. Save it as: hero-bg.mp4 in this directory (/public/)
3. The video should:
   - Loop seamlessly
   - Be optimized for web (consider compressing to reduce file size)
   - Have dimensions suitable for backgrounds (16:9 aspect ratio recommended)
   - Be relatively short (3-5 seconds) for faster loading

Example ffmpeg command to optimize:
ffmpeg -i your-video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -b:v 1000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k hero-bg.mp4

The video will display with:
- Full width/height coverage on desktop
- 20% opacity (low opacity as requested)
- Looping autoplay
- Muted audio (required for autoplay)
