8:T413,As a video editor and content producer for the Cool Worlds YouTube channel, I collaborate with professional astrophysicists to translate active research topics into accessible, visually compelling narratives. Over the past several years, I have edited and produced 30+ long-form videos and projects reaching over 10 million cumulative views worldwide.

My role goes beyond post-production. I actively participate in storyboarding, visual sequencing, and narrative pacing to ensure complex concepts—such as gravitational lensing, exoplanet detection methods, and cosmological modeling—are communicated accurately without overwhelming non-technical audiences. This requires deliberate choices about what technical detail to omit, what metaphors to introduce, and where precision must be preserved.

This work has fundamentally shaped how I design technical systems and research pipelines: documentation, clarity of intent, and the ability to explain why something works are treated as core engineering requirements rather than afterthoughts.9:T458,This project explores gravitational slingshot dynamics beyond the classical two-body approximation by modeling hyperbolic flybys in full three-body systems. I developed a custom symplectic N-body integrator and a batch-injection pipeline to simulate thousands of encounters across star–planet configurations, including close-in hot Jupiter systems.

Initial parameter sweeps are used to filter unsuccessful trajectories, followed by MCMC refinement to converge on high-deflection, high-energy-transfer encounters. The simulations reveal a narrow but robust window in which orbital angular momentum from a third body can be harnessed to produce velocity gains far exceeding matched two-body flybys. In some configurations, the resulting barycentric ∆v surpasses traditional planetary assists by orders of magnitude.

This work reframes optimization in chaotic systems as instance-finding rather than global maximization, and demonstrates how multi-body dynamical focusing can act as a natural gravitational engine. Results are validated through analytic–numerical comparisons and ongoing robustness testing.2:["$","$L7",null,{"project":{"id":"cool-worlds-outreach","slug":"cool-worlds-science-communication","title":"Cool Worlds Astrophysics Media & Outreach","shortDescription":"Long-form astrophysics storytelling and educational outreach for a global audience of millions.","fullDescription":"$8","tags":["science-communication","astrophysics","outreach","education","media"],"heroImage":"/projects/cool-worlds-science-communication/cool_worlds_timeline.png","gallery":["/projects/cool-worlds-science-communication/cool_worlds_timeline.png"],"videoDemo":"/projects/cool-worlds-science-communication/cool_worlds_motion_graphics.mp4","technologies":["Adobe Premiere Pro","After Effects","Motion Graphics","Compositing","Science Storytelling","Technical Visualization"],"links":{"channel":"https://www.youtube.com/@CoolWorldsLab"},"dates":{"start":"2022-01","end":"2026-02"},"featured":false,"order":8},"relatedProjects":[{"id":"three-body-slingshots","slug":"three-body-gravitational-slingshots","title":"Three-Body Gravitational Slingshot Dynamics","shortDescription":"Numerical investigation of energy amplification and orbital scattering in three-body gravitational slingshots around stars and planets.","fullDescription":"$9","tags":["astrophysics","orbital-dynamics","numerical-simulation","chaos","research"],"heroImage":"/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/three_body_energy_ceiling.png","gallery":["/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/three_body_energy_ceiling.png"],"videoDemo":"/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/trajectory_scatter_plot.mp4","technologies":["Python","Symplectic N-body Integrator","NumPy","SciPy","Matplotlib","MCMC (emcee)","Monte Carlo Sampling","Orbital Mechanics"],"links":{"github":"","paper":""},"dates":{"start":"2024-09","end":"2026-02"},"featured":true,"order":1,"sections":[{"title":"The Challenge","insight":"Two-body gravity assists plateau at 2√2 of the hyperbolic excess velocity","description":"Traditional planetary gravitational assists are limited by the topology of the hyperbolic trajectory.
