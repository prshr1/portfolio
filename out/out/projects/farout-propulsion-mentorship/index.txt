8:T447,As Rocket Project Lead and Propulsion Lead for the Columbia Space Initiative, I helped lead the end-to-end development of the university's first 6-inch, 115 lb hybrid rocket. The project required coordinating propulsion, structures, avionics, recovery, and test operations across a 50+ member undergraduate team while establishing a culture of documentation, safety, and repeatability.

On the propulsion side, I led the design and validation of nitrous–paraffin hybrid engines, performing transient thermal modeling, injector mass-flow analysis, and high-temperature FEA on nozzles and combustion interfaces. These models were validated through static hot-fire testing and thrust-curve correlation using a custom Python data-reduction pipeline.

Structurally, I directed the transition from a legacy 4.5" airframe to a modular 6.0" composite architecture, enabling higher chamber pressures, improved load paths, and more robust avionics integration. The project culminated in a successful flight at the Spaceport America Cup, marking a milestone for Columbia's undergraduate rocketry program.2:["$","$L7",null,{"project":{"id":"farout-propulsion","slug":"farout-propulsion-mentorship","title":"FAROUT Hybrid & Liquid Propulsion Mentor","shortDescription":"Propulsion safety, systems review, and technical mentorship for collegiate hybrid and liquid rocket teams.","fullDescription":"I serve as a hybrid and liquid propulsion safety and technical mentor for FAROUT (Friends of Amateur Rocketry: Oxidizers Uninhibited Tournament), a collegiate rocketry competition focused on advanced propulsion systems. My role involves reviewing propulsion hardware, feed systems, test procedures, and flight-readiness documentation for multiple teams across different institutions.\n\nBeyond formal reviews, I support teams through design iteration, failure analysis, and go/no-go decision-making during static fires and launch operations. This includes assessing single-fault risks, thermal and pressure margins, and operational readiness under real-time constraints.\n\nFor FAROUT 2025, I successfully oversaw multiple teams through safe static-fire and launch operations. For FAROUT 2026, I was appointed as an official team mentor for Columbia Rocketry and several international teams, providing ongoing guidance throughout their development cycles.","tags":["rocketry","safety-engineering","mentorship","operations","leadership"],"heroImage":"/projects/farout-propulsion-mentorship/farout_launch_ops.jpg","gallery":["/projects/farout-propulsion-mentorship/farout_launch_ops.jpg","/projects/farout-propulsion-mentorship/static_fire_pad.jpg"],"technologies":["Hybrid Propulsion","Liquid Propulsion","Safety Analysis","Fault Assessment","Test Operations","Pressure-Fed Systems","Technical Documentation"],"links":{"competition":""},"dates":{"start":"2024-01","end":"2026-02"},"featured":true,"order":5},"relatedProjects":[{"id":"csi-hybrid-rocket","slug":"columbia-hybrid-rocket","title":"Columbia Space Initiative Hybrid Rocket Program","shortDescription":"Propulsion and structural leadership for Columbia's first large-scale hybrid rocket, culminating in a successful full-scale flight.","fullDescription":"$8","tags":["rocketry","propulsion","systems-engineering","leadership","flight-hardware"],"heroImage":"/projects/columbia-hybrid-rocket/csi_hybrid_launch.jpg","gallery":["/projects/columbia-hybrid-rocket/csi_hybrid_launch.jpg","/projects/columbia-hybrid-rocket/hotfire_thrust_curve.png"],"technologies":["Hybrid Rocket Propulsion","Python","FEA","Thermal Analysis","Composite Structures","Instrumentation","DAQ","Systems Integration"],"links":{"teamsite":"","datarepo":""},"dates":{"start":"2019-09","end":"2023-06"},"featured":true,"order":4}]}]
