I designed and delivered a multi-part lecture series that reframes machining from first principles, starting with material hardness (BHN), unit power, spindle torque, and duty cycles.\n\nRather than optimizing for specific tools or machines, the framework emphasizes transferable reasoning applicable across different CNC platforms and materials. Topics include spindle power curves, thermal limits, tool engagement dynamics, chip thinning, and the tradeoffs between high-speed and high-efficiency machining.\n\nThe series enabled students to push machines confidently and safely, replacing fear-driven conservatism with informed judgment. The curriculum has since influenced shop SOPs and advanced workshop offerings.","tags":["manufacturing","cnc-machining","teaching","first-principles","cam"],"heroImage":"/projects/advanced-machining-fundamentals/spindle_torque_chart.png","gallery":["/projects/advanced-machining-fundamentals/spindle_torque_chart.png"],"videoDemo":"/projects/advanced-machining-fundamentals/adaptive_toolpath_demo.mp4","technologies":["Fusion 360 CAM","CNC Milling (Fadal, Tormach)","Machining Theory","Power Modeling","CAD/CAM Post-processing"],"links":{"slides":"","videos":""},"dates":{"start":"2025-04","end":"2025-05"},"featured":true,"order":3},"relatedProjects":[{"id":"cnc-lab-modernization","slug":"cnc-lab-modernization","title":"CNC Lab Modernization & CAM Enablement","shortDescription":"Modernization of legacy CNC infrastructure to enable high-precision, CAM-driven manufacturing at scale.","fullDescription":"As Lead Machinist and CNC Programmer in the Columbia Mechanical Engineering Teaching Lab, I was responsible for maintaining, restoring, and upgrading over ten CNC and manual machines used daily by hundreds of students. This included recommissioning a legacy Fadal VMC15, retrofitting Tormach mills with probing, tool-offset systems, and coolant upgrades, and restoring machines that had been out of service due to wear or control limitations.\n\nOne of the most impactful contributions was the development of a custom Anilam post-processor, enabling modern CAM toolpaths on older Fryer CNC mills that previously lacked full G-code compatibility. This effectively expanded the lab's CAM-capable machining capacity without purchasing new equipment.\n\nI also designed custom fixtures, machined tight-tolerance components, digitized tool inventories, and authored SOPs that significantly reduced downtime while improving safety and throughput during peak academic periods.","tags":["manufacturing","cnc","infrastructure","tooling","education"],"heroImage":"/projects/cnc-lab-modernization/fadal_vmc_restore.jpg","gallery":["/projects/cnc-lab-modernization/fadal_vmc_restore.jpg","/projects/cnc-lab-modernization/cnc_fixture_setup.jpg"],"technologies":["CNC Milling","CNC Turning","Fusion 360 CAM","Custom Post-processors","Machine Maintenance","Retrofits","GD&T","Metrology"],"links":{"postprocessor":""},"dates":{"start":"2023-08","end":"2025-06"},"featured":false,"order":6}]}]
