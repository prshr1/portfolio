d:T45f,This project explores gravitational slingshot dynamics beyond the classical two-body approximation by modeling hyperbolic flybys in full three-body systems. I developed a unified analytical and numerical framework to quantify energy ceilings in close-in gravitational slingshots, combining closed-form hyperbolic scattering theory with large-scale three-body Monte Carlo simulation in a hot Jupiter system. Starting from first principles, together with my PI, Dr. David Kipping, we derived strict two-body kinematic limits and geometric vector plateaus, then I built a high-fidelity integrator to test how real trajectories behave in a deep stellar potential. 

The results show that while no trajectory exceeds the stellar two-body energy ceiling, three-body dynamics can amplify energy gains far beyond classical planet-only bounds through structured angular momentum exchange consistent with conservation of the Jacobi constant. This project demonstrates rigorous theoretical derivation, invariant-based diagnostics, and large-scale numerical validation to uncover efficiency frontiers in multi-body orbital systems.2:["$","$Lc",null,{"project":{"id":"three-body-gravitational-slingshots","slug":"three-body-gravitational-slingshots","title":"Three-Body Gravitational Slingshot Dynamics","shortDescription":"","fullDescription":"$d","tags":["astrophysics","orbital-dynamics","numerical-simulation","chaos","research"],"heroImage":"/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/hero.jpg","gallery":["/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/best_candidate.png","/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/trajectory_tracks_planet.png","/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/velocity_phase_space.png","/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/energy_cdf.png","/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/parameter_correlations.png"],"videoDemo":"/projects/three-body-gravitational-slingshots/orbit_animation.mp4","technologies":["Python","Symplectic N-body Integrator","NumPy","SciPy","Matplotlib","MCMC (emcee)","Monte Carlo Sampling","Orbital Mechanics"],"metrics":"$undefined","links":{"github":"","paper":""},"dates":{"start":"2024-09","end":"Present"},"featured":true,"draft":false,"order":1,"accentColor":"#a78bfa","sections":[{"title":"Analytical Foundations","insight":"Hyperbolic Scattering and Energy Ceilings","description":"At the core of the project is a closed-form solution to two-body hyperbolic scattering.
