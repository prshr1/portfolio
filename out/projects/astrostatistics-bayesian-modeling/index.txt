d:T511,Integrated Statistical Inference in Observational Astrophysics
From Cosmological Expansion to Dark Matter Model Discrimination

Across five computationally intensive astrophysics investigations, I developed and validated a unified statistical inference framework spanning cosmology, stellar atmospheres, exoplanet detection, and galactic dynamics. The work integrates weighted regression, full Bayesian inference via custom Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, cross-validation protocols, and information-theoretic model comparison (AIC/BIC) to rigorously test competing physical hypotheses against noisy observational data.

Rather than applying statistical tools as black-box routines, I derived likelihood functions directly from physical models including Planck radiation laws, transit geometries, Keplerian radial velocity equations, and modified gravitational dynamics. I explicitly validated convergence, posterior structure, and residual behavior, with emphasis on diagnosing model degeneracies, parameter non-convergence, and regimes where data precision is insufficient for robust model discrimination. Synthetic data generation and controlled error scaling were used to estimate the minimum information threshold required for 5-sigma separation in dark matter versus MOND analyses.2:["$","$Lc",null,{"project":{"id":"astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling","slug":"astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling","title":"Astrostatistics & Bayesian Inference Projects","shortDescription":"","fullDescription":"$d","tags":["astrostatistics","bayesian-methods","data-analysis","modeling","research"],"heroImage":"/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/hero.jpg","gallery":["/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/hero.jpg","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig15_Lab1_HubbleTime_s01_lab_1_hubble_time_jorge_casas_pablo_drake_p01_3ea6a2e471.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig17_Lab1_HubbleTime_s02_the_relationship_between_distance_and_velocity_seems_linear_p01_3341e572d4.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig18_Lab2_BrownDwarfMCMC_s01_lab_2_mcmc_jorge_casas_pablo_drake_p01_75327a756e.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig20_Lab2_BrownDwarfMCMC_s01_lab_2_mcmc_jorge_casas_pablo_drake_p03_9a8e03dbc9.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig23_Lab3_Transits_s02_the_following_model_was_used_in_the_mcmc_algorithm_to_detren_p01_28cc9c00f6.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig26_Lab3_Transits_s03_the_transit_depth_of_0_000117_0_000004_with_respect_to_the_n_p01_290f07afe0.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig29_Lab4_RV_ModelSelection_s01_lab_4_model_sel_jorge_casas_pablo_drake_p01_027a223f4b.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig31_Lab4_RV_ModelSelection_s02_once_the_four_models_have_been_computed_we_calculate_several_p01_6cf8ac0cd0.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig01_DarkMatter_s01_ind_project_dark_matter_jorge_casas_p01_014de1aa98.png","/projects/astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling/Fig07_DarkMatter_s03_by_progressively_reducing_the_errors_in_a_hypothetical_data_p01_cdd66ae2d0.png"],"videoDemo":"$undefined","technologies":["Python","emcee","NumPy","SciPy","Pandas","Bayesian Inference","Statistical Diagnostics"],"metrics":"$undefined","links":{"notebooks":""},"dates":{"start":"2023-01","end":"2023-06"},"featured":false,"draft":false,"order":10,"accentColor":"#93c5fd","sections":[{"title":"Cosmological Parameter Estimation","insight":"Weighted regression plus bootstrap validation provides a reproducible estimate of $H_0$ and propagated cosmological timescales.","description":"Using Type Ia supernova distance modulus measurements, I re-estimated the Hubble constant via weighted least squares and independently verified the solution through bootstrap resampling.
