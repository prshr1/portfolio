8:T458,This project explores gravitational slingshot dynamics beyond the classical two-body approximation by modeling hyperbolic flybys in full three-body systems. I developed a custom symplectic N-body integrator and a batch-injection pipeline to simulate thousands of encounters across star–planet configurations, including close-in hot Jupiter systems.

Initial parameter sweeps are used to filter unsuccessful trajectories, followed by MCMC refinement to converge on high-deflection, high-energy-transfer encounters. The simulations reveal a narrow but robust window in which orbital angular momentum from a third body can be harnessed to produce velocity gains far exceeding matched two-body flybys. In some configurations, the resulting barycentric ∆v surpasses traditional planetary assists by orders of magnitude.

This work reframes optimization in chaotic systems as instance-finding rather than global maximization, and demonstrates how multi-body dynamical focusing can act as a natural gravitational engine. Results are validated through analytic–numerical comparisons and ongoing robustness testing.2:["$","$L7",null,{"project":{"id":"astrostatistics","slug":"astrostatistics-bayesian-modeling","title":"Astrostatistics & Bayesian Inference Projects","shortDescription":"A collection of Bayesian inference and statistical modeling projects applied to astrophysical data.","fullDescription":"This project collection includes multiple astrostatistics studies conducted during advanced coursework and independent research, focused on extracting physical insight from noisy or incomplete data.
