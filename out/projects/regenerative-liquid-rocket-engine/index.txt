8:T447,As Rocket Project Lead and Propulsion Lead for the Columbia Space Initiative, I helped lead the end-to-end development of the university's first 6-inch, 115 lb hybrid rocket. The project required coordinating propulsion, structures, avionics, recovery, and test operations across a 50+ member undergraduate team while establishing a culture of documentation, safety, and repeatability.

On the propulsion side, I led the design and validation of nitrous–paraffin hybrid engines, performing transient thermal modeling, injector mass-flow analysis, and high-temperature FEA on nozzles and combustion interfaces. These models were validated through static hot-fire testing and thrust-curve correlation using a custom Python data-reduction pipeline.

Structurally, I directed the transition from a legacy 4.5" airframe to a modular 6.0" composite architecture, enabling higher chamber pressures, improved load paths, and more robust avionics integration. The project culminated in a successful flight at the Spaceport America Cup, marking a milestone for Columbia's undergraduate rocketry program.2:["$","$L7",null,{"project":{"id":"regen-liquid-rocket","slug":"regenerative-liquid-rocket-engine","title":"Regeneratively Cooled Bi-Liquid Rocket Engine","shortDescription":"Design and fabrication of a low-resource, regeneratively cooled bi-liquid rocket engine under real manufacturing constraints.","fullDescription":"This project focuses on the end-to-end development of a regeneratively cooled bi-liquid rocket engine, designed and built under limited tooling and resource constraints. Without access to conventional CNC or additive manufacturing, the engine chamber and nozzle were fabricated from laser-cut, formed, and TIG-welded stainless steel sheet.\n\nI developed a custom 1D thermal model to simulate transient heat transfer along the chamber wall, coupling convective heating from combustion gases with conductive and convective heat removal by ethanol coolant channels. This model informed channel sizing, wall thickness, and allowable duty cycles near material yield limits.\n\nKey design decisions intentionally sacrificed peak performance in favor of survivability and manufacturability, including reduced feed pressures to maintain injector stability and thermal margins. The project emphasizes hardware-first iteration grounded in first-principles analysis, bridging propulsion theory with fabrication reality.","tags":["rocket-propulsion","heat-transfer","fabrication","systems-engineering","hardware"],"heroImage":"/projects/regenerative-liquid-rocket-engine/regen_chamber_welded.jpg","gallery":["/projects/regenerative-liquid-rocket-engine/regen_chamber_welded.jpg","/projects/regenerative-liquid-rocket-engine/thermal_profile_plot.png"],"technologies":["Python","RPA (Rocket Propulsion Analysis)","TIG Welding","Sheet Metal Fabrication","Fusion 360","SolidWorks","P&ID Development","Instrumentation"],"links":{"github":"","documentation":""},"dates":{"start":"2025-06","end":"2026-02"},"featured":true,"order":2,"sections":[{"title":"Design Constraints","insight":"Sheet metal + TIG weld, no CNC access—reframe for manufacturability","description":"Rather than design optimally then search for a machine, the project inverted the workflow: design for what we can actually build.
