8:T413,As a video editor and content producer for the Cool Worlds YouTube channel, I collaborate with professional astrophysicists to translate active research topics into accessible, visually compelling narratives. Over the past several years, I have edited and produced 30+ long-form videos and projects reaching over 10 million cumulative views worldwide.

My role goes beyond post-production. I actively participate in storyboarding, visual sequencing, and narrative pacing to ensure complex concepts—such as gravitational lensing, exoplanet detection methods, and cosmological modeling—are communicated accurately without overwhelming non-technical audiences. This requires deliberate choices about what technical detail to omit, what metaphors to introduce, and where precision must be preserved.

This work has fundamentally shaped how I design technical systems and research pipelines: documentation, clarity of intent, and the ability to explain why something works are treated as core engineering requirements rather than afterthoughts.2:["$","$L7",null,{"project":{"id":"cnc-lab-modernization","slug":"cnc-lab-modernization","title":"CNC Lab Modernization & CAM Enablement","shortDescription":"Modernization of legacy CNC infrastructure to enable high-precision, CAM-driven manufacturing at scale.","fullDescription":"As Lead Machinist and CNC Programmer in the Columbia Mechanical Engineering Teaching Lab, I was responsible for maintaining, restoring, and upgrading over ten CNC and manual machines used daily by hundreds of students. This included recommissioning a legacy Fadal VMC15, retrofitting Tormach mills with probing, tool-offset systems, and coolant upgrades, and restoring machines that had been out of service due to wear or control limitations.\n\nOne of the most impactful contributions was the development of a custom Anilam post-processor, enabling modern CAM toolpaths on older Fryer CNC mills that previously lacked full G-code compatibility. This effectively expanded the lab's CAM-capable machining capacity without purchasing new equipment.\n\nI also designed custom fixtures, machined tight-tolerance components, digitized tool inventories, and authored SOPs that significantly reduced downtime while improving safety and throughput during peak academic periods.","tags":["manufacturing","cnc","infrastructure","tooling","education"],"heroImage":"/projects/cnc-lab-modernization/fadal_vmc_restore.jpg","gallery":["/projects/cnc-lab-modernization/fadal_vmc_restore.jpg","/projects/cnc-lab-modernization/cnc_fixture_setup.jpg"],"technologies":["CNC Milling","CNC Turning","Fusion 360 CAM","Custom Post-processors","Machine Maintenance","Retrofits","GD&T","Metrology"],"links":{"postprocessor":""},"dates":{"start":"2023-08","end":"2025-06"},"featured":false,"order":6},"relatedProjects":[{"id":"machining-fundamentals","slug":"advanced-machining-fundamentals","title":"Fundamentals of Advanced Machining (Teaching Series)","shortDescription":"A physics-first approach to CNC machining, replacing folklore with power, torque, and material reasoning.","fullDescription":"This teaching project was developed to address a recurring gap in machining education: students could follow feeds-and-speeds tables but lacked a generalized understanding of why machines behave the way they do. I designed and delivered a multi-part lecture series that reframes machining from first principles, starting with material hardness (BHN), unit power, spindle torque, and duty cycles.\n\nRather than optimizing for specific tools or machines, the framework emphasizes transferable reasoning applicable across different CNC platforms and materials. Topics include spindle power curves, thermal limits, tool engagement dynamics, chip thinning, and the tradeoffs between high-speed and high-efficiency machining.\n\nThe series enabled students to push machines confidently and safely, replacing fear-driven conservatism with informed judgment.
